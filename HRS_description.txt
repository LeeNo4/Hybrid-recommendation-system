Method Description:
In this project, I used 5 methods to make predictions. The first and second ways are to use SVD and ALS methods in surprise package. 
Then I extracted 2 features from user.json(review_count&average_stars) and 2 features from business.json(stars&review_count). I combined 
these features to use machining learning algorithm to make prediction. After that I also used item-based and user-based CF to get another scores.
At last, I trained linear regression model by above 5 results and average&max&min scores for users. 
I got the intercept and coefficients to predict final scores.
